Content Insights:
This week, I gained practical experience in creating and customizing a child theme for my VR Therapy site.
The process involved setting up a new directory for the child theme, creating the necessary style.css and functions.php files, and making various customizations to the site's appearance.

Customizations Included:

Background Color: Changed the background color of the site to a light grey.
Header Customization: Modified the header’s background color and text color to improve readability.
Font Styles: Applied a new font family to the body text for better aesthetics.
Navigation Menu Styling: Changed the color of the navigation menu links to align with the brand’s color scheme.
Footer Appearance: Customized the footer’s background and text color for a more cohesive look.
Button Styles: Adjusted the button styles, including background color, text color, and border radius for a modern look.
These customizations were added to the style.css file of the child theme. Additionally, I created a functions.php file to enqueue the parent and child theme styles properly.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Developing a child theme provided valuable insights into WordPress theme development.
Understanding how to create and customize child themes is essential for maintaining and updating websites without losing custom modifications.
This skill is crucial for any web developer, as it ensures the longevity and maintainability of websites.

Learning to work with child themes also improved my understanding of CSS and WordPress’s enqueue system.
These skills are directly applicable to real-world web development scenarios, making me more versatile and proficient in managing WordPress sites.

Reflection:
Creating and customizing the child theme was both challenging and rewarding.
Initially, setting up the child theme and ensuring it properly inherited the parent theme’s styles required careful attention to detail.
However, once the setup was complete, making visual customizations became straightforward.

The process reinforced the importance of using child themes to preserve customizations during updates.
It also highlighted the significance of testing changes thoroughly to ensure they function as expected.

This week's task of developing a child theme for VR Therapy not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided a deeper appreciation for the flexibility and power of WordPress as a CMS.
I look forward to exploring more advanced customization techniques and further refining my skills in WordPress development.
