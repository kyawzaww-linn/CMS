Journal Entry: Week 7 - PHP Programming
Week: Week 7

Learning Activities:
This week focused on PHP programming, with the goal of writing and running PHP code that demonstrates key programming concepts. The task involved creating dynamic web pages that incorporate various PHP features.

Resources:

Introducing PHP (Video)
PHP with MySQL Essential Training (Video)
PHP Documentation
Estimated Hours:

Learning PHP basics: 3 hours
Writing PHP code: 4 hours
Testing and debugging: 3 hours
Group project work: 2 hours
Content Insights:
This week, I gained practical experience in PHP programming, focusing on writing code that interacts with HTML to create dynamic web pages. The key concepts I applied included echoing HTML content, using control structures (if/else), loops (for, while, foreach), and functions with parameters. I also learned how to include common elements (like headers and footers) across multiple pages using PHP’s include function.

Key PHP Features Implemented:

Echoing HTML: Displayed dynamic content based on user input.
Control Structures: Implemented logic to handle different user actions.
Loops: Used loops to display lists of items dynamically.
Functions: Created reusable code blocks to simplify the codebase.
Includes: Structured the website by separating common elements into separate files.
Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Learning PHP is essential for back-end web development, particularly for creating dynamic and interactive websites. The skills I developed this week, such as working with control structures, functions, and includes, are directly applicable to real-world web development projects.

Understanding how to write and structure PHP code efficiently not only enhances my technical abilities but also improves my problem-solving skills, which are crucial for any developer.

Reflection:
This week’s work with PHP was challenging but rewarding. The most significant challenge was debugging the code to ensure that it worked as expected across different scenarios. However, overcoming these challenges reinforced my understanding of PHP and its role in web development.

I’m excited to continue integrating PHP into our group project and to see how these skills will help me in future web development tasks.
