Content Insights:
This week, I gained hands-on experience with Joomla, a CMS known for its flexibility and extensive customization options. 
Unlike WordPress, Joomla offers a more complex user interface but provides higher control over user management and multilingual capabilities. 
I learned about the basic structure of a Joomla site, including how to customize templates and modules to fit the needs of my virtual reality therapy startup. 
Adjusting the default Joomla installation to make my site unique was challenging but rewarding, as it helped me understand the importance of CMS in web development.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Working with Joomla provided me with a broader perspective on how different CMSs can be leveraged for specific needs in web development. 
This experience is crucial for my career as it diversifies my skill set, making me adaptable to various platforms depending on project requirements. 
It also highlighted the significance of understanding the technicalities behind each CMS to effectively manage web projects and meet client expectations.

Reflection:
Navigating Joomla was initially intimidating due to its complex interface compared to WordPress. 
However, as I delved deeper, I appreciated its robustness and suitability for complex websites. 
This week's practical task of creating a Joomla site for my startup pushed me to apply what I learned immediately, reinforcing my understanding through practice. 
I look forward to refining my skills further and exploring other CMSs to become a versatile web developer.
