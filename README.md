I was reminded of the importance of the separation of content (HTML) and style (CSS) for maintainability and flexibility in web development. 
The practical task of developing a simple static website for my startup using basic web technologies was particularly enlightening. 
It reinforced the idea that even simple technologies can be powerful tools in creating functional and aesthetically pleasing websites.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

The hands-on approach to creating a website from scratch was a valuable exercise in applying theoretical knowledge to real-world applications. 
This experience emphasized the importance of a strong foundational understanding of web technologies, which are crucial skills in the tech industry.
Moreover, the task pushed me to think critically about the design and functionality of a website from a business perspective, enhancing my employability skills by aligning technical skills with business acumen.

Reflection:

This week was quite intensive but extremely rewarding.
Building the simple static site for my startup not only consolidated my understanding of web design principles but also sparked a greater interest in exploring more advanced web technologies. 
It’s clear that the skills developed here are not just academic; they are directly applicable to the tech industry.
I look forward to enhancing these skills further and exploring CMS platforms in the coming weeks.
