Week: Week 4

Learning Activities:
This week focused on setting up a local development environment and preparing for the deployment of a WordPress site. 
The goal was to demonstrate a dynamic site with a database running on my localhost and to understand the processes involved in development and deployment workflows.

Resources:
Mapping the Modern Web Design Process
Version Control for Everyone
Migrating WordPress with WP Migrate DB and DB Pro

Estimated Hours:
Setting up MAMP and configuring the environment: 3 hours
Installing and customizing WordPress: 5 hours
Troubleshooting issues and ensuring everything works: 4 hours

Content Insights:
This week, I successfully set up a local development environment using MAMP to host my WordPress site, VR Therapy.
The process involved installing MAMP, creating a database using phpMyAdmin, and configuring WordPress to connect to the database.
I encountered and resolved a database connection issue by carefully verifying the wp-config.php settings and ensuring the correct credentials were used.

Customizing the site included installing essential plugins like Elementor for page building and Yoast SEO for optimizing the siteâ€™s search engine presence.
I chose a theme that aligned with the VR Therapy brand and customized it by adjusting site identity settings, colors, and fonts.
Creating pages such as Home, About, Services, and Contact provided a structured and professional look to the website.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Setting up and customizing a WordPress site locally has been an invaluable experience for my web development skills.
Understanding the workflow of developing locally and preparing for deployment is crucial for any web developer.
This process highlighted the importance of having a reliable local environment for testing and development before moving to a live server.

Learning to troubleshoot issues, such as database connection problems, has enhanced my problem-solving skills and confidence in handling technical difficulties.
The hands-on experience with plugins and theme customization has also broadened my understanding of WordPress's capabilities, making me more adaptable to various project requirements in the future.

Reflection:
The initial setup and configuration of MAMP and WordPress were challenging, especially resolving the database connection error.
However, overcoming this issue taught me valuable lessons in persistence and attention to detail.
Customizing the WordPress site to reflect the VR Therapy brand was a creative and fulfilling process, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge practically.

This week's tasks have significantly improved my understanding of development and deployment workflows.
The practical experience of setting up a local environment, customizing a site, and preparing for deployment has prepared me well for future web development projects.
I am looking forward to further refining my skills and exploring more advanced features of WordPress and other CMS platforms in the coming weeks.
